# Power Line Fault Detection Using Machine Learning and Deep Learning

Partial discharge and uneven voltages are the reason for various electrical
hazards. Once begun, Partial Discharge causes progressive deterioration of
insulating materials, ultimately leading to electrical breakdown. The effects of
PD within high voltage cables and equipment can be very serious, ultimately
leading to complete failure.
The project deals with the prediction of partial discharge patterns in signals
acquired from power lines employed across regions. These power lines capture
voltages per 20 milli seconds. Effective classifiers using this data will make it
possible to continuously monitor power lines for faults.
The solution that we have come up with is feeding these voltage samples to
various Machine Learning and/or Deep Learning algorithms and finding out if
they can distinguish and predict partial discharge for a new voltage sample. The
end result after implementing Convolutional Neural Network and Bidirectional
LSTM was positive.
